# Contributing to sync-it

**sync-it** is a no-code, SAFe-aligned program under **Hale Yeah! Holdings**.  
We track planning artefacts (Airtable CSVs, n8n exports, PI demos) here—no app code lives in this repo.

## How to add new assets
1. Fork or branch from `main`.
2. Place CSVs in `/planning`, n8n workflow JSON in `/workflows`, and images in `/assets`.
3. Open a pull request with a descriptive title (“Add PI-1 epic CSV”).
4. One team member reviews for naming and folder conventions.
